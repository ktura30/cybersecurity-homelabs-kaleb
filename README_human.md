Hey! I'm Kaleb Tura, a third-year IT major diving deep into cybersecurity. These are two simple but meaningful projects I worked on to build hands-on skills outside of class.

## 🔐 Project 1: Vulnerability Assessment on My Personal Windows PC

**What I did:**  
I ran a basic vulnerability assessment on my own Windows system using free tools like Nmap and Nessus Essentials. My goal was to get familiar with how real-world scans work and learn what kinds of vulnerabilities show up on everyday systems.

**Tools I used:**  
- Nmap  
- Nessus Essentials  
- Windows Defender  
- Windows Security settings  

**What I learned:**  
- How to perform basic port scans  
- How to use Nessus to detect vulnerabilities  
- How to understand risk levels (low/medium/high)  
- Why regular updates and patches are so important  

This gave me a better understanding of how vulnerable even a personal computer can be — and how to protect it.

## 🔎 Project 2: Wi-Fi Network Security Checkup

**What I did:**  
I decided to audit my home Wi-Fi network to make sure it was properly secured. I checked the router settings, turned off risky features, and scanned the network for unknown devices.

**Checklist:**  
- Updated router firmware  
- Changed default login credentials  
- Confirmed WPA2/WPA3 encryption  
- Disabled WPS and UPnP  
- Used Fing to check for unknown devices  

**Tools I used:**  
- Router admin panel  
- Fing mobile app  
- NetSpot / WiFi Analyzer  

**What I learned:**  
- How small security settings can open big holes  
- How to clean up and secure a home network  
- The importance of knowing what devices are connected
